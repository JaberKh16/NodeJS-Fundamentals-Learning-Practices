NodeJS package.json File Concept
================================
In NodeJS, a single files named- package.json is used
to controll the packages and dependencies for the node
project. 

package.json file will be look like something like this-
    {
        "name": "1.lodash-package",
        "version": "1.0.0",
        "description": "",
        "main": "1.lodash-practice-1.js",
        "scripts": {
            "start" : "node 1.lodash-practice-1.js", 
            "dev": "nodemon 1.lodash-practice-1.js"
        },
        "keywords": [],
        "author": "",
        "license": "ISC",
        "dependencies": {
            "lodash": "^4.17.21"
        }
    }

/*
    Route Level Middleware Concepts
    ===============================
    Router-Level Middleware works in the same way as Application-Level Middleware, 
    except it is bound to an instance of express.Router()/
        
        const router = express.Router();

    Loading Route Level Middleware using the router.use() or router.method()
    functions.

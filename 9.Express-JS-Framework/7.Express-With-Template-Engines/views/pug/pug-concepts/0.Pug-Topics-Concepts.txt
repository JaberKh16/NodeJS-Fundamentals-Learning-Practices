Pug Language Concepts Learning
==============================
a. Working With Attributes:
    1. defining multiple attributes
        - Attributes can be define inside (href='', data-toggle='')
    2. defining attributes with long value
        - attributes with long values can be define using '{}'
        Example:    
            input(data-json({
                "very-long": "piece of ",
                "data": true
            }))
    3. with quoted/conflicting attributes
        - attributes are conflicting with js syntax such as [] or (), 
          enclose them with '' or "" is required.
        Example:
            div(class='div-class', (click)= 'doSomething()') # (click) is considers as js function call
        To fix this use-
            div(class='div-class', '(click)' = 'doSomething()')
    4. passing variables to attributes
        - to pass variables to attributes use the following ways:
                -var url = 'something.com'
                a(href=$(url)) Click here
                - var btnType = 'info'
                - var btnSize = 'lg'
                button(type='button' class='btn btn-' + btnType + ' btn-' + btnSize)
                |
                |
                button(type='button' class=`btn btn-${btnType} btn-${btnSize}`)

    5. working with unescaped attributes
        - by default all attributes are escaped - speciall characters are replaced with
        with escape sequence to prevent cross site attack. If required use != instead of =
        Example-
            div(escaped ='<code>')
            div(unescaped !='<code>')
    6. working with boolean attributes
        - boolean attributes also aquire programming concepts- Booleans basically
        mirrored by Pug.
        Example-
            input(type='checkbox' checked)
            input(type='checkbox' checked=true)
            input(type='checkbox' checked=false)
            input(type='checkbox' checked=true.toString())
            doctype html  # for 'html' pug knows not to mirror
    7. working with style attributes
        - 'style' can be string as well as an object
        Example-
            p(style="background: blue")
            body(style={background-color:'#ddccaa', color:'black'})
    8. working with class attributes
        - 'class' can be string like normal attribut, but it can also be array or object 
        of class names.
        Example-
            - var classes = ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']
            a(class=classes)
            //- the class attribute may also be repeated to merge arrays
            a.bang(class=classes class=['bing'])

            - var currentUrl = '/about'
            a(class={active: currentUrl === '/'} href='/') Home
            |
            |
            a(class={active: currentUrl === '/about'} href='/about') About

b. Working With Normal JS Expresion/JS Variable, directly in .pug File:
    - use the following way:
        - const authenticated= false;
        body(class=authenticated ? 'auth': '')
c. Working With Multi-Line:
    - use pipe(|) to make a line.
    Example:
        html
            head
            |
            |
            title
d. Working With Case Conditionals
    1. working with 'case' statement
        - 'case' statement in pug is shorthand for 'switch' in programming concepts.
        - simmilar like syntax as switch statement but the difference is when any
        block is empty then need to use 'break'.
        Example-
            1. Non Block Expression With (Fall Through, break)
                -var value = 1;
                case value
                    when 0
                        p Value is #{value}
                    when 1
                        p Value is #{value}
                    when 2
                    when 3
                        p Value is repeated
                    when 5
                        - break
                    default
                        p Value is #{value}
            2. Block Expresion
                -var friends = 1
                case friends
                    when 0: p you have no friends
                    when 1: p you have a friend
                    default: p you have #{friends} friends

e. Working With Code
    1. working with unbuffered code
        - any code starts with '-'
        Example-
        1. Non-block Code
            - for(let i =0; i<10; i++)
            li item
        2. Block Code   
            - 
                var list = ['Home', 'Services', 'About']
                each item in list
                    li item
    2. working with unbuffered code
        - any code starts with '=', directly evalautes the expression
        Example-
            p
              = 'This code is <escaped>'
            p= 'This code is <escaped>'
            p(style="background: blue")= 'A message with a ' + 'blue' + ' background'
    3. working with unescaped buffered code
        -  starts with !=. It evaluates the JavaScript expression and outputs the result. 
        Unescaped buffered code does not perform any escaping, so is unsafe for user input.
        Example-
            p
                != 'This code is <strong>not</strong> escaped!'
            p!= 'This code is <strong>not</strong> escaped!'

f. Working With Comments
    1. //       --> buffered comment single line(appreance on html code)
    2. //-      --> unbuffered comment single line(unappreance on html code)
    3. //-      --> block comment 
        //
    4. doctype html comment                 --> conditional comments
        <!--[if IE 8]>
        <html lang="en" class="lt-ie9">
        <![endif]-->
        <!--[if gt IE 8]><!-->
        <html lang="en">
        <!--<![endif]-->

g. Working With Conditionals
    1. working with if/else 
        Example-
            - var user = {description: 'foo bar baz'}
            - var authorised = false
            #user
            if user.description
                h2.green Description
                p.description= user.description
            else if authorised
                h2.blue Description
                p.description.
                User has no description,
                why not add one...
            else
                h2.red Description
                p.description User has no description
    2. working with 'unless' negation of if
        Example-
            unless user.isAnonymous
                p You're logged in as #{user.name}

h. Working With Interpolation
    1. working with escaped string interpolation
        Example-    
            - var title = 'Page Title'
            p #{title}
    2. working with unescaped string interpolation
        Example-
            - var riskyBusiness = "<em>Some of the girls are wearing my mother's clothing.</em>";
            div.quote
                p Joel: !{riskyBusiness}
    3. working with tag interpolation
        Example-
            p.
                This is a very long and boring paragraph that spans multiple lines.
                Suddenly there is a #[strong strongly worded phrase] that cannot be
                #[em ignored].
            p.
                And here's an example of an interpolated tag with an attribute:
                #[q(lang="es") ¡Hola Mundo!]
    4. working with whitespace interpolation
        - The tag interpolation syntax is especially useful for inline tags, where whitespace 
        before and after the tag is significant. By default, however, Pug removes 
        all spaces before and after tag.
        Example-
            p
                | If I don't write the paragraph with tag interpolation, tags like
                strong strong
                | and
                em em
                | might produce unexpected results.
            p.
                If I do, whitespace is #[strong respected] and #[em everybody] is happy.

i. Working With Iterator/Loops
    - Pug supports two types of iteration: each and while
    Example-
        1. 'each' Loop
            
            ul
                each val, index in ['zero', 'one', 'two']
                    li= index + ': ' + val

            - var values = [];
            ul
            each val in values
                li= val
            else
                li There are no values
        
        2. 'while' Loop

                - var n = 0;
                ul
                while n < 4
                    li= n++

j. Working With Mixins
    - In Pug, mixins allows to create resuable blocks.
    1. mixins as simple block
        //- declaration
        mixin list
            ul 
                li Item-1
                li Item-2
        //- use
        +li
        +li
    2. mixin as complied to function with arguments
        mixin petName(name)
            li.petName= name
        ul
            +petName('cat')
            +petName('dog')
            +petName('pig')
    3. mixin as block of Pug as content
        mixin article(title)
            .article
                .article-wrapper
                h1= title
                if block
                    block
                else
                    p No content provided

        +article('Hello world')

        +article('Hello world')
            p This is my
            p Amazing article
    4. mixin with default arguments value
        //- Declaration
        mixin article(title='Default Title')
            .article
                .article-wrapper
                h1= title

        //- Use
        +article()

        +article('Hello world')

    5. mixin with rest arguments
        mixin list(id, ...items)
            ul(id=id)
                each item in items
                li= item

        +list('my-list', 1, 2, 3, 4)

k. Working With Plain Text
    1. working with inline in a tag
        - easiest way to add a plain text using inline.
        Example-
            p This is plain old <em>text</em> content.
    2. working with literal html
        - Whole lines are also treated as plain text when they begin with a left 
        angle bracket (<), which may occasionally be useful for writing 
        literal HTML tags in places that could otherwise be inconvenient.
        Example-
            <html>
            body
                p Indenting the body tag here would make no difference.
                p HTML itself isn't whitespace-sensitive.
            </html>
    3. working with piped text
        - Another way to add plain text to templates is to prefix a line with a 
        pipe character (|). This method is useful for mixing plain text
        with inline tags.
        Example-
            p
                | The pipe always goes at the beginning of its own line,
                | not counting indentation.
    4. working with block in a tag
        - when wanted large block of text within a tag say - js code or css code
        writing in script or style tags. To a block tag use dot(.) after the 
        tag name.
        Example-
            script.
                if (usingPug)
                    console.log('you are awesome')
                else
                    console.log('use pug')

l. Working With tags
    1. Block Expansion- On Nested Tags
        - to safe space Pugs provides inline syntax for nested tags.
        Example-
            a: img
    2. Self Closing Tags
        - Tags such as img, meta, and link are automatically self-closing 
        (unless you use the XML doctype).Can also explicitly self close 
        a tag by appending the /
        Example-
            foo/
            foo(bar='baz')/

m. Working With Inclusion - 'include'
    - Pugs supports different files inclusion to provide the features of resuablity
    of cotent.
    Example-
        //- index.pug
        doctype html
        html
            include includes/head.pug
            body
                h1 My Site
                p Welcome to my super lame site.
                include includes/foot.pug

        //- includes/head.pug
        head
        title My Site
        script(src='/javascripts/jquery.js')
        script(src='/javascripts/app.js')

        //- includes/foot.pug
        footer#footer
            p Copyright (c) foobar

    1. Inclusion Of Plain Text
        Example-
            //- index.pug
            doctype html
            html
            head
                style
                include style.css
            body
                h1 My Site
                p Welcome to my super lame site.
                script
                include script.js

            /* style.css */
            h1 {
                color: red;
            }

            // script.js
            console.log('You are awesome');

    2. Inclusion Of Filtered Text
        Example-
            //- index.pug
            doctype html
            html
                head
                    title An Article
                body
                    include:markdown-it article.md
            
            # article.md
            This is an article written in markdown.

n. Working With Template Inheritance - block and extends keywords
    - Pug supports template inheritance. Template inheritance works via the 
    block and extends keywords. Template inheritance basically means
    passing some block of code to child templates to inherits.

    In a template, a block is simply a “block” of Pug that a child template may replace. 
    This process is recursive. Pug blocks can provide default content.
    Example-
        //- layout.pug
        html
            head
                title My Site - #{title}
                block scripts
                script(src='/jquery.js')
            body
                block content
                block foot
                #footer
                    p some footer content

    To extend this layout, create a new file and use the 'extends' directive with a 
    path to the parent template. (If no file extension is given, .pug is automatically
    appended to the file name.) Then, define one or more blocks to override
    the parent block content.
            //- page-a.pug
            extends layout.pug

            block scripts
                script(src='/jquery.js')
                script(src='/pets.js')

            block content
                h1= title
                - var pets = ['cat', 'dog']
                each petName in pets
                    include pet.pug

            //- pet.pug
            p= petName

    Now, Pug allows you to replace (default), prepend, or append blocks.

    Suppose you have default scripts in a head block that you wish to use on 
    every page. You might do this:
        //- layout.pug
        html
        head
            block head
            script(src='/vendor/jquery.js')
            script(src='/vendor/caustic.js')
        body
            block content

        //- page.pug
        extends layout.pug

        block append head
            script(src='/vendor/three.js')
            script(src='/game.js')

    When using block append or block prepend, the word “block” is optional:
        //- page.pug
        extends layout

        append head
            script(src='/vendor/three.js')
            script(src='/game.js')
